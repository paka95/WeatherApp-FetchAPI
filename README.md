# WeatherApp-FetchAPI
Simple weather app showcasing fetch API usage


App was built with https://openweathermap.org API. Simply register yourself there to get a free API key and start using it. 
If you would like to use this project, simply clone it and input your own API key in main.js file.
https://openweathermap.org is very nice, simple and easy to use. I would highly recommend start using it with your own simple projects. Its documentation is straighforward.

App searches for the current weather in any given place - it geocodes the city and then fetches data based on longitude and latitude of that city.
Since this is a very simple app, it has a couple of things that could be improved - for instance it is not very accurate when the place is not specific or small enough.
